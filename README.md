FLAME2
======

Please note that FLAME2 has been migrated from an svn repository. It is possible, therefore, that some of the branches might not have all the expected shared history with their parent branch etc. In particular, please note that the previous folder in the svn repository `flame2/production` is now the master branch in this git repository. Also, the development folder (`flame2/development`) is on its own git branch.
