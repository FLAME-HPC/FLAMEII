 * \brief Build parameters
 *
 * This file is generated by the ./configure script. Do not edit.
 *
 * Changes to parameters in this file will trigger a relink of the libs
 * (thanks to api/dummy.hpp) as well as all objects that include it. This
 * solves the issue of changes to --prefix done post-make not being accounted
 * for in the rpaths of libs as well as in sources that rely on the path
 * (such as the xparser when locating installed templates).
